# PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-Job-Simulation-on-Forage
I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively.  I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. 
Firstly, I worked on for a Telecom Marketing Company named Phonenow, the Call Center manager got in touch with me to create a visualization which she could use as a basis for discussion with the management. Hence I began to create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics gathered from the Call Center Manager.
During this exercise the KPIs and metrics were given as follows:- 
Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
Total number of calls answered and abandoned, Speed of answer, Length of calls, Overall Customer Satisfaction, An accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior.
