# PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-Job-Simulation-on-Forage
I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively.  I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. 
Firstly, I worked on for a Telecom Marketing Company named Phonenow, the Call Center manager got in touch with me to create a visualization which she could use as a basis for discussion with the management. Hence I began to create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics gathered from the Call Center Manager.
During this exercise the KPIs and metrics were given as follows:- 
Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
Total number of calls answered and abandoned, Speed of answer, Length of calls, Overall Customer Satisfaction, An accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior.

Follow the link below to interact with the Dashboard on PowerBI:-

GOING ON, New tasks were assigned, After presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

Problems the Retention Manager needed solutions for; 
-Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
-The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
-Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
-We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
-We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

Here is your task
Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

Define proper KPIs
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

Answers
1). KPIs are like scorecards for businesses. They are specific, measurable goals that show how well a company is doing in areas that are crucial for its success. KPIs help organizations understand if they are meeting their objectives and where they need to improve. For example, in sales, a KPI could be the number of products sold in a month. If the company sells more than the set target, it's a positive KPI, indicating good performance. KPIs vary based on what a business wants to achieve, providing clear goals to work toward.

3). From my analysis, The Fibre Optic Internet Service is really failing, reporting with the highest percentage of Churn from its service. An increase in Tech Support for the Fibre Optic would really bolster its service use and reduce its churn percentage.

The sale of tickets both Tech and Admin did well but most customers opted for the admin tickets, a slight reduction in the Tech tickets might get more customers back in its corner.

The rate of Churn of Month to Month contracts are quiet bad, from my analysis i noticed most customers are drawn to the 1 year and 2 year contracts. An increase in sale of the 1 and 2 year contracts would attract customers with it's availabilty, also a 5% reduction in the Month to Month cost would be attractive.

Probably you can ask more than half of the population in the world which Payment Method they would love best and Bank Transfer and Credit Card will be all you here, from my analysis it was also the same. I would suggest a 5% yearly Increase in Bank Transfer and Credit Card payments and also Tech Support should ensure little or no complains are made against the 2 methods.
